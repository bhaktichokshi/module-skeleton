# module-skeleton [v1.0.0]
Skeleton framework to kickstart and organize projects like a pro.

## 🚀 Why Module Skeleton?

Starting a project shouldn’t feel like dragging yourself through a swamp of folder-making and file-setup.  
If you're like me — jotting down ideas and quickly scripting before the spark fades — the last thing you want is to spend your energy *setting up* instead of *building.*

**Enter: Module Skeleton.**  
This ready-to-go framework builds a professional project structure for you, so you can jump straight into the fun part: *coding.*

---

## 🛠️ What It Does

The `module-skeleton` script **automatically** creates a standard directory structure, drops in essential files, and organizes everything with minimal effort.  
No more *mkdir this*, *touch that* — just run and done.

---

## ✨ Key Benefits

- **Consistency:**  
  Every project starts with the same solid foundation. No weird folder chaos.
  
- **Efficiency:**  
  Save HOURS by skipping manual setup. Focus on your code, not your folders.

- **Maintainability:**  
  Easy to navigate, easy to collaborate, easy to keep clean.

- **Onboarding:**  
  Hand a project to a teammate or future-you, and they’ll *instantly* understand the structure.
